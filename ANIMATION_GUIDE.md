## Animated Status Indicators

Your app now supports both animated GIFs and videos for the status indicators! Here's how to use them:

## üîÑ How to Switch Between Formats

In `index.html`, find the `applyVentilationTheme` function and change:
```javascript
const useVideo = false; // Set to true for videos, false for GIFs
```

## üìÅ File Structure

Place your animated files in the `images/` directory:

### For GIFs:
- `images/good.gif`
- `images/caution.gif`  
- `images/danger.gif`

### For Videos:
- `images/good.mp4`
- `images/caution.mp4`
- `images/danger.mp4`

## üé® Animation Suggestions

### ‚úÖ GOOD Status (Green)
**Mood**: Calm, positive, reassuring
- **GIF Ideas**: Gentle pulsing green circle, checkmark appearing, subtle breathing animation
- **Video Ideas**: Soft green glow that slowly brightens/dims, gentle particle effects
- **Duration**: 2-3 seconds loop

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION Status (Yellow/Orange)  
**Mood**: Alert but not panic, cautious attention
- **GIF Ideas**: Warning triangle with gentle pulse, amber light blinking slowly
- **Video Ideas**: Subtle yellow/orange wave animation, caution symbol with soft glow
- **Duration**: 1.5-2 seconds loop

### üö® DANGER Status (Red)
**Mood**: Urgent, attention-grabbing, but not overwhelming
- **GIF Ideas**: Red pulsing (faster than caution), X mark with emphasis, stop sign animation
- **Video Ideas**: Red alert pulse, urgent but smooth transitions
- **Duration**: 1-1.5 seconds loop

## üéØ Design Tips

### Visual Hierarchy:
1. **Animation should enhance, not distract** from the main message
2. **Keep it subtle** - users will see this frequently
3. **Maintain circular crop** - animations will be displayed in a circle
4. **Consider dark/light themes** - animations should work with the app's color-changing themes

### Performance:
- **GIFs**: Better browser compatibility, but larger file sizes
- **Videos**: Better compression, smoother animation, but need fallbacks for older browsers
- **Test on mobile** - ensure smooth performance on all devices

## üöÄ Implementation Examples

### Quick GIF Setup:
1. Create/find your animated GIFs
2. Name them `good.gif`, `caution.gif`, `danger.gif`
3. Place in `images/` folder
4. Set `useVideo = false` in code
5. Done! ‚úÖ

### Video Setup:
1. Create your MP4 animations
2. Name them `good.mp4`, `caution.mp4`, `danger.mp4`  
3. Place in `images/` folder
4. Set `useVideo = true` in code
5. Test on various devices üì±

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Animation not showing?**
- Check file names match exactly
- Verify files are in `images/` directory
- Check browser console for loading errors

**Performance issues?**
- Reduce file sizes
- Try shorter loop durations
- Test GIFs vs videos to see what works better

**Mobile problems?**
- Ensure videos have `playsinline` attribute (already included)
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just desktop browser mobile view

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Subtle is better** - Your users will see these animations many times
2. **Test with real content** - Make sure animations don't interfere with reading
3. **Consider accessibility** - Some users prefer reduced motion
4. **Optimize for performance** - Smooth animations are better than flashy large ones

Happy animating! üéâ
